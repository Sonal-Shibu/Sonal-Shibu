# Sonal Shibu
- Oh, hi there! nice to see you! ðŸ‘‹ I am @Sonal-Shibu, I have recently graduated from Brunel University with a masterâ€™s in mechanical engineering. As an engineer my love of coding started rocky using scratch (don't judge we all started from nowhere!) then MATLAB and thanks to MATLAB I saw the pure power of coding. Creating a code to see a signal response of a motor or the integrals of a function with the respect to time. Ever since then i was hooked. 
# What am I doing you ask?
- As the previous section mentioned I studied to become an engineer but one thing I noticed my math classes and coding classes weren't related. We were taught differential equations then seeing how these equations define every physical law (for example fluid mechanics), then we use a program to find fluid properties. To me this is cool but not okay as a student. I have a natural curiosity of to see the inner workings of the code! So here I am creating engineering and mathematical solvers for engineers to use along their studies! 
- Therefore, my repositories are going to contain solvers with (highly) commented code and user manual with physics I have used to justify the solutions! And understand the logical thinking to writing code. 
# My Code Experience :computer:
- I am known for my genetic engineering algorithm. My code is currently being evaluated by the engineering team for Formula student as a solver for two-dimensional maximising and minimising problem.
- Time dependent moving load simulator for a crane carrying different loads 
# What am I learning and my future goals? :books:
- Iâ€™m currently learning Applied calculus on edX and Scientific Computing with Python on free codecademy, I want to move on to machine learning
  ## Future goals :dart:
- I want to use my machine learning knowledge to develop and algorithm which can be applied it to engineering topics, such as optimisations. 
# Collaboration :handshake:
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mathematical models or solvers or data analysis. As my repositories show; I understand maths and physics to a high level. Moreover, through the many years in university I have done many data analysis tasks. For example, my dissertation (thesis) was partly data analysis of cooling of a car battery simulation with different cell lengths and different cell layout. The simulation was done in Ansys Fluent. Then with 5000 data points per cell length per cell layout. I analysed and graphed data using Python 3.
